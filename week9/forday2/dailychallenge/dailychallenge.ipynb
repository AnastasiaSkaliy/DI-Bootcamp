    "Introduction:\n",
    "The challenge at hand involves leveraging OpenAI's ChatGPT model to perform data analysis on the Iris dataset. ChatGPT is a powerful language model based on GPT-3.5 architecture, known for its natural language understanding and generation capabilities. While ChatGPT is proficient in understanding and responding to textual prompts, it's essential to recognize its primary function as a language model rather than a tool designed for numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Body:\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT Model Choice:\n",
    "ChatGPT was selected for its conversational capabilities, enabling the formulation and interpretation of queries in natural language. This aligns with the desire for an interactive and intuitive approach to data analysis discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonymization and Batching:\n",
    "To enhance privacy and security, the 'Species' column of the Iris dataset was anonymized using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This one-way transformation ensures that the original species names cannot be retrieved from the anonymized values. Batching queries allows for the efficient processing of multiple questions simultaneously, enhancing productivity in data analysis workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries and Results:\n",
    "A batch of queries was formulated to analyze the Iris dataset, focusing on statistical measures related to petal length. The queries were structured to extract meaningful insights, such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum petal lengths for the entire dataset and each species. The responses from ChatGPT were collected and displayed, providing a conversational perspective on the requested statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "In conclusion, this exercise highlights the adaptability of ChatGPT in facilitating data analysis conversations. The anonymization process ensures data privacy, while batching queries streamlines the analytical workflow. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of ChatGPT in numerical computations and recognize that for rigorous statistical analysis, dedicated libraries like NumPy and Pandas are more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the capabilities and constraints of ChatGPT is essential for leveraging it effectively in data-related tasks. While it excels in natural language understanding and generation, it's not a substitute for specialized tools designed for numerical analysis. Striking a balance between the strengths of ChatGPT and other data analysis tools contributes to a more robust and insightful exploration of datasets.\n",
